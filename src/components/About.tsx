                    <p className="lead mt-4 text-justify">I began to learn Programming about 5 years ago and Website Development recently, completely self-taught from online resources and lots of tests. I started with C++ and Python as I was curious about Game and Discord Bot Development, but then switched to website development since I also curious on how websites and apps integrated.</p>
                    <p className="lead mt-4 text-justify">I'm still learning every day, but I've got used with TypeScript and used it for both frontend and backend things. I love the problem-solving aspect of coding and the satisfaction of realizing an idea to something real in the browser.</p>
